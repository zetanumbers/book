#### Myosotis: 2.0 You Can (Not) Forget

Today I would like to make a claim about what would look like
the most ergonomic implementation of unforgettable types. I think
ergonomics problem is the largest obstacle on the path to innovation

when it comes features with implicit trait bounds due to consensus of
such features being unergonomic. I believe major part of this avoidance
is not justified due to several unique properties of unforgettable types.
